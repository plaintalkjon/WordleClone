I'm following a tutorial online that teaches how to program Wodle in JavaScript in 20 minutes.

Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKM2nQdQkIU

Objectives:
1. Complete the tutorial.
2. Aggressively research each step to ensure I understand it thoroughly.
3. Understand enough to add my own feature to the game beyond what the tutorial offers.
    a. As of this time, I'm thinking an abandon button that allows you to try again with a new word but with 1 fewer row.
